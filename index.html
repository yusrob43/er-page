  <p>10 Things You Need to Know That May Save your Life!</p>
    
  <p>  I am compelled/driven to write this book to help all patients and family members navigate themselves through today’s emergency room process in order to try to prevent what almost happened to this 7-week old baby from happening to other unsuspecting potential victims.  I wish I could say that this was the only story!</p>
    
    <p>True story!</p> 
    <p>A new mom brought her 7-week old infant into an emergency room, almost fully staffed with new graduate nurses, for a minor illness.  The doctor ordered 7.5mg of Benadryl.  A brand new graduate nurse did not know that Benadryl came in a liquid form.  Therefore, the new nurse took a 25mg pill, crushed it, and then mixed it in 25 ml’s of water (medicine cup).  The new graduate nurse did not know that Benadryl and water do not mix equally.  She drew up an unknown amount of Benadryl in a syringe to give to the baby; she was about to overdose that new mom’s brand new 7-week old baby.  That mom did not know how close she came to losing her 7-week old baby that day.  See by the time the mother (who lived in a busy metropolis) would have arrived home in rush hour traffic with baby in the rear of the car there is a good chance that the 7-week old baby would have stopped breathing and lost it’s heartbeat.  When is this ever an acceptable accident?
    
    We owe it to you, as a healthcare system of a great nation, to provide you with excellent safe healthcare!  If you cannot feel safe in an American ER: then where can you feel safe!
    
    Therefore, I write this book because it angers me that we have become a country where patients aren’t provided what they’re entitled to and substandardness has become the NORM!  It angers me that we live in a healthcare system where mediocracy has become the deliverable and excellence has become a thing of the past or is viewed as a privilege for only the chosen few: when the underpinnings of a Great Nation is dependent on the healthiness of its Nation!
    
    Read and find out what you are entitle to, how to navigate yourself, how to prevent near-deaths, know your providers, know what you are missing, and most importantly what to do if these things happen to you.  Over 100 hundred nurses, all with more than 20 years of experience, have comprised tools to get you armed for the battle!  And if you do not think it is a battle in today’s ER’s: …well, it is our sworn duty to be your advocate.
    
    As a nurse for over It is my vision that these chosen 10 items will help save a countless number of lives

  <h2>About The Author - S.R. Ridley</h2>
  <p> Why are you writing this book?</p>
  <p>  I am writing this book because of the atrocities that I am seeing in health care today.  I am writing this book to arm people with the power that they need to protect their health care, the health care of their loved-ones, and the health care of the entire United States of America. I am writing this book not to bash the healthcare system we have today. I am writing this book to enlighten people and to provide them the tools they need to navigate themselves through the emergency room process to so that they are educated consumers. 
    
    I have tried to help the system from within, but it fell upon deaf ears. When I graduated from nursing school over two decades ago, I took the Florence Nightingale pledge. That pledge meant something to me. I became a nurse to become a champion and patient advocate for my patients.  I have diligently tried to help patients from within the system. I tried to make suggestions as to how we can bring safe health care back to the way it was many years ago.  When it was at its crux; when healthcare was great. Does a great nation make healthy people or do healthy people make a great nation? That is the question that remains the underpinnings of this great country. Providing safe healthcare is not an item for sale. It is not an item that you go into a store and purchase off of the shelf.  Providing safe excellent health care is a must; it’s an American right. 
    
    In order to grow and continue as a great nation we have to have great people. In order to have great people we have to have healthy people.  Trying to navigate patients within a healthcare system enveloped by a bureaucracy that is determined to do the opposite is challenging.  After trying and failing many times, the only thing I can do is to help patients from the outside, and hope that the impact of this knowledge will disseminate and penetrate the inside. Therefore, if I arm my patients with what they need to navigate themselves effectively within the healthcare system that exist today, then maybe, just maybe I can help save a life.  
    
    The goal of this book is not to reach just one person.  The goal of this book is reach thousands and to have the thousands disseminate the knowledge to the millions.  After over twenty years in this field I am not doing it for the money.  I am doing it because I care about my patients as I care about all patients.  How much would you pay for your loved-ones safety?  A wonderful Army Veteran and friend once said “There is no reset button on life: you are only given one!”
    
    It is our job as healthcare providers to provide you with the best care that we cannot the most economical care.  Remember this is The United States of America.  This is a great nation.  People come here to receive their healthcare from all over because we are supposed to have the best healthcare system and the quality and patient safety factor of that system is crumbling exponentially!</p>

  <p class="wallOfTruth">Why is this information important for people to know?</p>
  
<p class="wallOfTruth">It is important for people to know that when they enter today’s emergency room there is a paucity of experienced providers available to properly assess and care for themselves or their loved-ones.  This reality and the near-death incident that occurred to the 7-week old baby that I mentioned on the back cover of this book is why I am compelled to fuel people with the knowledge they need to be safe in today’s E.R.’s.  Incidents such as that one and many more have plagued healthcare for the last decade.  I believe that it is your right to receive safe healthcare from competent providers. 
  
  What is happening to healthcare is that the business side of healthcare has removed the power away from the doctors and nurses and replaced it with a robotic-like healthcare system that uses human healthcare providers as pawns such as ones on a chessboard.  The businessman, who have no healthcare knowledge, have placed new nurses, new doctors, new physician assistants, and sometimes-new nurse practitioners within in emergency rooms to care for unsuspecting people such as yourselves.  As a patient you are entering a world that places no value on experience and plays Russian roulette with your life.  The one token charge nurse who may have more than 2 years experience is driven by the monetary factor and not patient safety. </p>

  <p class="wallOfTruth">True Story!</p>
  
  <p class="wallOfTruth">A 78 y/o female patient enters a well-known and respected teaching facility for a possible heart attack.  She is placed in a room with no working lights. The nurse caring for the patient notifies the charge nurse that he is going to move the patient to his other empty room where the lights are working.  However, the charge nurse emphatically tells him to leave the patient in the dark room as for she is going to bring a small vaginal spotlight to the room for the providers to use.  Now here lies the problem with this true story.  It is unethical for a patient to be left in a dark room.  It is unethical to expect a healthcare provider to be able to perform their job effectively to a patient they cannot even see.  Even though this particular charge nurse had over 15 year experience she has forgotten the pledge she took to be a patient advocate and has now become a robotic-token for the institution.  When is it ever all right to treat a human with such depravity, or with such iniquities?  Is this what our healthcare system has been relegated to?  Would you feel safe in this E.R. under this charge nurses management?
  
  When a nurse (RN) graduates from nursing school he/she is given a basic generic healthcare foundation.  It is through the RN’s first job, first preceptor that shapes the new graduate’s nursing philosophy and provides the underpinnings of true patient safety.  Nowadays individuals who do not even know the definition of healthcare dictate an RN’s training.  These individuals are referred to as businessmen.  These businessmen sit in their ivory tower offices and make dismal decisions, which have deleterious effects on healthcare today.  For example, hiring 90% new graduate nurses in emergency rooms all across America, who have not even acquired the ebasic nursing skills of how to maintain a stable patient independently.  These new inexperience nurses who trained by other inexperience nurse (with 6 months to a year experience) are placed in E.R.’S as novices where the wrong split second decision can kill i.e. 7-week old baby.  Somehow we have become a society that does not respect experience but champions ignorance
  
  We are living in a society where doctors are just hired hands (usually without more than 5 to 7 years experience) that function like puppets on a string.  And if they do not “playball” then with the system then they are fired or allowed to remove themselves from their position. </p>  
  
  
  <p class="wallOfTruth">What has happened to health care is that brand new nurses have been placed in positions that they have not been trained for they have not developed the critical thinking skills necessary to properly function in today’s E.R.’s.  And we place these brand new nurses in the emergency room.  The emergency room nurse is a very special nurse.  He or she is what I call a healthcare detective. This is not the place where you come to learn how to be a nurse.  This is the specialty that you do when you already know how to be a nurse, have developed critical thinking skills, have experience to draw from in order for you to protect and serve.  This is the place that when you walk in the door an experienced seasoned nurse can look at you, rapidly assess you, and navigate you to where you need to go immediately.  The emergency room is a place where seconds matter and time is not always forgiving.</p>
